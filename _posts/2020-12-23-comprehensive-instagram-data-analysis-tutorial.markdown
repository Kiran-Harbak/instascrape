title: "Comprehensive Instagram data analysis and visualization tutorial"
---

Hello everyone,

I recently scraped 10,000+ data points from Donald Trump's Instagram page using `instascrape` and decided to
create a data visualization tutorial!

Check out this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/chris-greening/instascrape/blob/master/tutorial/examples/DonaldTrump/Donald%20Trump.ipynb)
and the associated [dataset](https://github.com/chris-greening/instascrape/blob/master/tutorial/examples/DonaldTrump/donald_trump.csv). The tutorial
uses `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` to conduct the analyses and is geared heavily towards visualization.

I also wrote two blog posts on the topic:

1. [Scraping 10,000 data points from Donald Trump's Instagram page with Python](https://dev.to/chrisgreening/scraping-10-000-data-points-from-donald-trump-s-instagram-page-with-python-2jcg)
2. [Visualizing Donald Trump's Instagram data with Python](https://dev.to/chrisgreening/visualizing-donald-trump-s-instagram-data-with-python-1f01)

The first article goes over how I synergized `instascrape`, `selenium`, `beautiful soup`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` to gather
the dynamically rendered Instagram content, scrape the data, and perform some quick analyses and visualizations.

The second article is an introduction to the Jupyter Notebook tutorial and contains all the visualizations you can expect to work with.

If you have any ideas of tutorials you would like to see in the future, let me know!

Happy holidays,

Chris
