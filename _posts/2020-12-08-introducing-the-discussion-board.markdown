title: "Introducing the discussion board"
---

Hello everyone, 

I opened up a [discussion board](https://github.com/chris-greening/instascrape/discussions) on the repo for

- discussions
- questions
- presentations of your projects that involve instascrape
- links to others scraping projects
- ideas and brainstorming
- etc.

I'm really excited to hear from everyone and see what you've been working on so feel free to use the discussion board as a place to open up these dialogues!

Catch you later, 
Chris
