title:  "The next few weeks for instascrape"
---

Heyo everyone, 

I'm really comfortable with the progress _instascrape_ has made over the last two months and I figure 
it's a good time to let everyone know what I see in the foreseeable future regarding _instascrape_ development. 

Now that the library is in a comfortably stable condition and people are actually starting to use it, there are 
a few key areas of focus I'll be spending my attention on for the next few weeks. 

Primarily, I am going to be focusing on:

- legitimizing _instascrape_ as a responsible Python package by setting up version release notes so people know what the heck I'm up to
- proper documentation; the docs I have up [currently](https://instascrape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) are passable but are in sore need 
of improvement lol
- full, easy-to-follow tutorials for all features (might be some Youtube vids in the future but will focus on dedicated tutorial for this site first)
- improved exception handling; I've had a couple emails that could have been easily resolved with a more descriptive error message, sorry about that guys
- general promotion; I've been floating around the internet posting about the library but I really want to ramp my efforts up
- improving on existing features; the current features are certainly powerful but I want to add refinements to emphasize the power in the hands of the user  
- increase test coverage substantially 
- etc. 

I have a lot of ideas floating around in my head and now that I have some more free time coming up this Winter, I'm ready to crank out a 
ton of improvements so really keep an eye out for those. If you're interesting in hoppin' on the dev train, email me or hit me up on social media. 
I definitely would not mind getting some regular contributors more involved with the dev process.

Cheers,
Chris
